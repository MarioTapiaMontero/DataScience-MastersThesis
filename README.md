# The 15-Minute City for Tourists
## Data Science Master's Degree Thesis

---
##  Description 
This Thesis focuses on identifying the most walkable areas of a city for tourists, using a proposed Tourism Walkability Index within the framework of the 15-minute city concept. It examines Naples and Venice to assess how well hotels and BnBs are connected to well-reviewed nearbyattractionsandrestaurants, usingdatafromTripAdvisor,Airbnb,andOpenStreetMap. In both cities, hotels, which are more concentrated, tend to have better walkability than BnBs, whicharemorespreadout. Atthecitylevel,theresultsshowthatVenicehasmoreconsistently distributed walkability, while Naples exhibits greater variability, with a higher proportion of accommodations having high walkability scores. The relationship between walkability and accommodationpricing is also analyzed, revealing that accommodations with higher walkability tend to have higher prices. This analysis was conducted using multiple linear regression and regression trees. The study highlights the economic and experiential benefits of walkable environments for both cities and tourists, respectively.
